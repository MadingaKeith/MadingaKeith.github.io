    <p>Biggie was a rapper that appeared in the late 90's, He started on the streets selling crack then used that money to fund his first songs. People love his sound (obviously), then he was on a quick rise to fameover the next few years. His flows and storyteller were unmatched. He went from Biggs to Big poppa. True legend.</p></div>

    <p>Tupac Shakur, famously known as 2Pac, probably one of the most influencial artists of his time. His parents being black panthers means he grew up with a distrust of the police. Uisng this he used his artist voice to get injustices heard all over America and later to the world. Really does do deserve to be with the greats.</p></div>
